# stock-analysis
**Overview of Project:**
The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the stock market from 2017 to 2018. For each Ticker there is a summary of ‘Total Daily Volume’ and ‘Return’ on stock for each year. 

**Results:**
Create a script to loop through stocks all stocks for the designated timeframe to obtain Ticker Volumes, Starting, and Ending Prices, which were used to provide the overall Volume and Returns for each stock. 

The data contained 12 unique ‘Tickers’. The analysis for 2017 showed that 11 of 12 Tickers had positive returns as represented by the green cells, however the analysis for 2018 showed that 10 of 12 Tickers had negative returns as represented by the red cells.

The original execution times of the scripts were 1.03 seconds (2017) and 1.08 second (2018). Through the utilization of the refactored script, the execution times were greatly reduced .24 seconds (2017) and .19 seconds (2018). Refer to attached .PNG files 2017 RunTime; 2018 RunTime; VBA_Challenge_2017; VBA_Challenge_2018 respectively. 

**Summary:**
There are several advantages associated with refactoring code, such the ability to readily identify bugs in the code, faster and more efficient programming, as well as the ease of understanding software. These factors contribute to an overall better-quality code. On the other hand, some disadvantages of using refactored code is that you may not be familiar with the code that is being used, which may require retesting. Refactoring the original VBA script for the challenge was an advantage because most of the code remained unchanged and we did not have to reinvent the wheel to execute the additional scripts.
